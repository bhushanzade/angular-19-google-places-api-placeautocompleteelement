## What is Google Places API?

The Google Places API is a service that provides detailed information about places, such as businesses, landmarks, and geographic locations. It allows your application to search for places, retrieve place details, autocomplete place names, and more.

### Why Use Google Places API?

- **Rich Data**: Access up-to-date information about millions of places worldwide, including names, addresses, ratings, reviews, photos, and opening hours.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Implement features like location autocomplete, place search, and displaying place details to make your app more interactive and user-friendly.
- **Geolocation Features**: Easily integrate location-based functionality, such as finding nearby places or displaying places on a map.

### Where to Use Google Places API?

- **Search Bars**: Provide autocomplete suggestions as users type place names or addresses.
- **Maps Integration**: Show detailed information about selected places on Google Maps.
- **Location-Based Services**: Build features like "find nearby restaurants," "show popular landmarks," or "get directions to a place."
- **Forms**: Simplify address entry by letting users select from suggested places.

By integrating the Google Places API, your Angular application can deliver powerful location-aware features with minimal effort.

## Steps to activate google places

### 1. Enable Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click **Add project** and follow the setup steps.
3. Once your project is created, click the gear icon and select **Project settings**.
4. Under **Your apps**, register your web app and follow the instructions to add Firebase SDK to your Angular project.
5. Copy the Firebase config object and add it to your Angular environment files.

### 2. Enable Google Places API

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project (or create a new one).
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
4. Search for **Places API** and click **Enable**.
5. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials** and create an API key.
6. Restrict the API key for security (HTTP referrers recommended).
7. Use the API key in your Angular app to access Google Places services.


### 3. Configure API Key in `googlemap.service.ts`

1. Open the `googlemap.service.ts` file in your Angular project.
2. Instead of hardcoding your API key, import the environment configuration:
  ```typescript
  import { environment } from '../environments/environment';
  ```
3. Use `environment.googleMapsApiKey` (or your configured key name) wherever the API key is required, for example:
  ```typescript
  const apiKey = environment.googleMapsApiKey;
  ```
4. Make sure your `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` files contain the `googleMapsApiKey` property with your actual API key:
  ```typescript
  export const environment = {
    // ...other properties
    googleMapsApiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  };
  ```
This approach keeps your API key secure and makes it easy to manage different keys for development and production.
